[Description]
	clib is stand for C (language) library, it reverse libc
	from 10/5/2010 it has new name piece-of-c or short name piece-c
	I write for hobby.
	Now it just implement string and other auxilary function.
	Read header file in include directory to see what functions 
	I has been implement
	piece-c also provide a util for simple unix command.
[Compiling] 
	On any Unix machine has gcc compiler. Do these step to compile and install.
	You may read [Note] below before going to compiling.
	make
	make install 
	No need to call ./configure, but to make it easy also have a configure file to call
	Default it install to your system in :
		/usr/include/piece for header  and lib in /lib64
	Use make install prefix=<where> to prefix path 
[Note]
	Complete code can compile on x86_64.If compile on 32bit part of code
	will compile. NOT ALL
	The diffence between 32 and 64 are very clear, because
	it base on hardware very high
	Each time compile the chseries script will change the series of clib
	in file piece/piece.c
	I has been compile for win32 with Mingw 32 but 
	I dont write configure for modify code for win32
